## R Markdown and Leaflet

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() 
my_map <- my_map %>% addMarkers(lat=38.3451700, lng= -0.4814900, popup="Home")
my_map
